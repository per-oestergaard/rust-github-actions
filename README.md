# rust-github-actions

An opinionated collection of GitHub Actions for Rust projects.

The purpose is to make it easy to have a list of standard actions across Rust projects.

## TO DO

<https://github.com/geiger-rs/cargo-geiger>
<https://github.com/cackle-rs/cackle>
<https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/01/23/Introducing-cargo-audit-fix-and-more.html>
<https://lib.rs/crates/cargo-deps-list>

Make local small rust project and CI/CD to test the actions, also as example

How to utilize docker? Build a docker with all the tools? Can it be pre-build? And from ubuntu-latest? How is it cached if not?
